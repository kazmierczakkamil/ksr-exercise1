sci.electronics	re a question about vac outlet wiring crisp ecsvax uncecs edu russ crisp writes so here s my question it seems to me that i d have the same electrical circuit if i hooked a jumper from the neutral over to the ground screw on new three prong grounding outlets what s wrong with my reasoning here may i respectfully suggest you not do this the ground is supposed to be a protective ground and though what you suggest looks good on paper it s dangerous to rely on the same wire for power and protection it d never meet code and if you now own the property and later sell it you may end up with liabilities you don t want and if you don t now own it well there s a wiring faq that i think addresses this i believe an alternative is use of a gfci but i m really not sure what current code allows in this area the gfci senses alternate unwanted current paths and doesn t rely on a specific protective ground wire at least not beyond the gfci in the protected circuit gfci breakers are available but expensive

sci.electronics	grounding power wiring was re a question about vac outlet wiring there has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here a few points need to be clarified the equipment grounding conductor green green with a yellow stripe bare or the metal sheath or pipe of some wiring methods is used as a safety ground to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects it should never except for a few exceptions to be discussed later carry the normal operating current of a connected load some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation orange outlets are often used for this with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box and in many cases back to the service anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the national electric code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems the code requires the insulated grounding conductors green wires to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box and if required back all the way to the service entrance where it is bonded to the service ground water pipe or rod many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either the grounded conductor of a circuit often called the neutral which is referred to in the code as the identified conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey this conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point generally at the service entrance panel this connection is through the main bonding jumper in many household service panels the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel the grounded conductor neutral is generally a current carrying conductor in the case of a volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device since the grounded conductor neutral is only connected to the grounding conductor bare or green at the service entrance if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load under normal operating conditions if you should incorrectly connect the grounded neutral conductor to the grounding conductor at the load some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end if the load equipment has a metal case which is connected to the grounding conductor through the u ground plug the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential the difference under normal non short circuit conditions may be only a few tenths of a volt but it could also be a volt or two this normally does not present a shock hazard however if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe a radiator a metal air conditioning duct or such part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path if the contact is not solid you will get a significant arc a low voltage but possibly moderate current arc under the wrong conditions this arcing could start a fire it is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current could also flow through a wire of inadequate size causing it to overheat with the incorrect non single point grounding of the neutral if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor which increases the possibility for shock or fire also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment often causing malfunction i have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment the neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling this is done primarily for lightning protection so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly the bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer some of it flows through the grounding electrode water pipe etc this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks and it may also cause measurable ac magnetic fields due to the large loop between the hot conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground there are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy don t flame me on this i m just telling you where the field comes from not it s health effect as far as i m concerned the jury is still out on this note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel not at any sub distribution panels this is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral the sheath can be used in this application only as the grounding conductor if the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground with the possible problems listed above the code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers as well as feeds from one building to another in the cases of the range and dryer the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions instead of a seperate wire every time the code is revised these exceptions come up for review these exceptions were in fact the first required safety grounds in the days before u ground outlets and such the appliance manufacturers don t want to have to redesign their ranges and driers and the contractors don t want to have to run four wire cable with four fairly heavy expensive wires in place of three wire to the appliances no question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove but the neutral current is low for most burner settings since most current is in the volt hots except at some low settings the wires are large gauge and there are few reported cases of injury or damage so far the exceptions have survived in the case of feeds between buildings it s primarily for lightning protection people doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn t a legal grounding conductor obviously the bare wire in romex with ground is anywhere there is a green wire installed such as in a portable cord that is a good grounding conductor the sheath of bx clamped in bx connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor in the us bx has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath you can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends you don t have to bond it to anything it does its job by touching every turn of the bx sheath conduit or emt thinwall tubing is generally a legal grounding conductor but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel particularly for larger pipes greenfield looks like big bx but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it is not a legal grounding conductor as it doesn t have the aluminum band to bond it and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance you have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield wiremold is also not a legal grounding conductor as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact and the feed to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box i have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were hot with volts why do i get a shock every time i touch my computer and the radiator here in the office because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box you must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring conduit bx etc where you can bond the wire to the box with a screw bnding clip or whatever on another issue while you should ground the green wire lug on gcfi outlets when ever there is a place to ground them it is legal in the nec to use them without a ground if no ground is available it is better to have the protection of the ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don t install it the interrupter doesn t depend on the ground to trip it is desirable to connect the ground if available because if the ground is connected the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in whereas without the ground it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path for those questioning the legal use of ungrounded gcfi s read in the nec d exception this is the code my code is in the city but i know the rule hasn t

intelligence unit passed confidential police files on california political activists to a spy ring the fbi and san francisco police are investigating the adl bullock and gerard over the affair and last week searched the adl s offices in san francisco and los angeles the suit alleges invasion of privacy under the civil code of california which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources it seeks exemplary damages of at least per person as well as other unspecified damages lawyer pete mccloskey a former congresmen who is representing the plaintiffs said the plaintiffs included arab americans and jews and his wife helen who also had information gathered about her one of the plaintiffs is yigal arens a research scientist at the university of southern california who is a son of the former israeli defence minister arens told the san francisco examiner he had seen a file the adl kept on him in the s presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of palestinians and his position on the israeli occupied territories according to court documents released last week bullock and gerard both kept information on thousands of california political activists in the documents a police investigator said he believed the adl paid bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and bullock received confidential

the adl claims to protect against none of us is violent or criminal in any way said carol el shaieb an education consultant who develops programs on arab culture the plaintiffs include yigal arens son of former israel defense minister moshe arens the younger arens a research scientist at the university of southern california said the adl kept a file on him in the s presumably because he has criticized israel s treatment of palestinians the adl believes that anyone who is an arab american or speaks politically against israel is at least a closet anti semite arens said the adl has denied any wrongdoing but couldn t comment on the lawsuit because it hasn t reviewed it said a spokesman at the adl s new york headquarters the fbi and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that the adl spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups including white supremacist and anti semitic organizations arab americans greenpeace the national association for the advancement of colored people and san francisco public television station kqed some information allegedly came from confidential police and government records according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit no charges have been filed in the criminal investigation the lawsuit accuses the adl of violating california s privacy law which forbids the intentional disclosure of personal information not otherwise public from state or federal records the lawsuit claims the adl disclosed the information to persons and entities who had no compelling need to receive it it didn t elaborate defendants include richard hirschhaut director of the adl s office in san francisco he did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment other defendants are san francisco art dealer roy bullock an alleged adl informant over the past four decades and former police officer tom gerard gerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed information on to bullock gerard who has retired from the police force has moved to the philippines bullock s lawyer richard breakstone said he could not comment on the lawsuit because he had not yet studied it upwe adl sued for allegedly spying on u s residents san francisco upi a group of california residents filed suit wednesday charging the anti defamation league of b nai brith with violating their privacy by spying on them for the israeli and south african governments the class action suit filed in san francisco superior court charges the adl and its leadership conspired with a local police official to obtain information on outspoken opponents of israeli policies towards the occupied territories and south africa s apartheid policy the adl refused to comment on the suit the suit also took aim at two top local adl officials and retired san francicso police officer tom gerard claiming they violated privacy guarantees in the state constitution and violated state confidentiality laws according to the suit gerard helped the adl obtain access to confidential files in law enforcement and government computers information from these files were passed to the foreign governments the suit charges the whole concept of an organized collection of information based on political viewpoints and using government agencies as a source of information is absolutely repugnant said former rep pete mccloskey who is representing the plaintiffs the adl s information gathering network was revealed publicly last week when the san francisco district attorney s office released documents indicating the group had spied on people and political and ethnic groups for more than years my understanding is that they the adl consider all activity that is in some sense opposed to israel or israeli action to be part of their responsbility to investigate said arens a research scientist at the university of southern california the adl believes that anyone who is arab american or speaks politically against israel is at least a closet anti semite the fbi and the district attorney s office have been investigating the operation for four months the plaintiffs in the case include arens the son of former israeli defense minister moshe arens in a press release the plaintiffs said the alleged spying had damaged them psychologically and economically and accused the adl of trying to interfere with their freedom of
